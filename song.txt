Look into my eyes and see in them your worth reflection
Tearing all the templates invented in tranquillity
Our highest goal is slaughtering by domination
New step, spit on what you call morality
Paradox stepping up the brink of fucking social
To isolated from society
In our hearts, lies the secret formula of life
Grin so they think you're fucking fine, man
Just throw your eyes away and see the pain
You look at me, and you're feeling all your pathetic fears
You just have nothing to say, you are nothing
You feel like through your veins flows your fucking tears
